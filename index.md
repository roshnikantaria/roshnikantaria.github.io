I am Roshni Kantaria, a young Syndey-based visual artist! I come from 6 years of fine art schooling and industry experience in mural-painting as well. I’m dedicated to creating a life-like painting that masterfully captures your love story like no-other.

A traditional painting transcends photography – it captures emotion, movement and lighting in a highly personalised and artistic manner. I’m excited to commemorate the elements most important to you whether it is your dress, the gorgeous day, or the family getting together – lets find your vision for the canvas!
